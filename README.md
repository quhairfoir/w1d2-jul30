First LHL project

## Objective
Very cool little finger algorithm to multiply some numbers. 

## How it works
1. Let's say I want to multiply two numbers (single digit) from 6-10
2. I use my fingers to represent each number in one hand... the following applies:
  thumb = 6
  index = 7
  middle = 8
  ring = 9
  pinky = 10
3. Join all the fingers that represent the 2 numbers being multiplied.
4. Then, count how many fingers are joined... x10.
5. Lastly, count roaming fingers from left hand and multiply bu roaming fingers in right hand. 
6. Add step 4 and step 5.
